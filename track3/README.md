# thinkingearth-hackathon-track3

This repo contains resources for track 3 of the [ThinkingEarth Hackathon](https://thinkingearth-hackathon.devpost.com/?_gl=1*u5l5q*_ga*MTU5NDcyMTA0My4xNzUwMDg1MDYw) at [BiDS 25](https://www.bigdatafromspace2025.org/satellite-event-submission), which targets at exploring the usage of Earth Observation (EO) Vision-Language models. 

## Tasks
Select or customize one specific topic, then complete one project related to one or more EO Vision-Language datasets and models. You may explore fine-tuning strategies, adapt models across geographies or modalities, identify limitations, develop novel use cases related to EO applications, or any other interesting ideas.

Visit the [hackathon page](https://thinkingearth-hackathon.devpost.com/?_gl=1*u5l5q*_ga*MTU5NDcyMTA0My4xNzUwMDg1MDYw) for detailed organization information.

## Submissions
Participants must submit the following materials through the dedicated platform by the end of the development phase:
- Project description outlining the problem addressed, approach taken, and relevance to the selected track
- Source code used to develop the solution (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, scripts, or repositories)
- Documentation explaining how to run the code, key methods used, and any dependencies or requirements
- Demo or presentation materials showcasing the solution and its functionality (e.g., slides, short video, screenshots)

A convenient way is to create a github repo with all the required materials and share the link in your submission:
- a README.md file containing project description, code documentation, and access to the presentations
- source codes
- presentation or link to the presentation

## Judging Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of four expert judges based on:
- Effectiveness
- Efficiency
- Novelty
- Clarity
- Impact potential
