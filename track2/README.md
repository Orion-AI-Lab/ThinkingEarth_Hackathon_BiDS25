# Track 2: Weather forecasting models

This track centers on assessing and extending the capabilities of state-of-the-art weather models. Participants are encouraged to develop new evaluation frameworks and apply models to a variety of downstream forecasting tasks to identify strengths and gaps in current approaches.

## Materials

This repository contains all the materials and information for track 2 of the hackathon. Participants will find everything they need to build their projects, including:

- [ ] Implementations of state-of-the-art weather forecasting models
- [ ] Introduction of possible downstream tasks to evaluate
- [ ] Access to 2018 data from the ERA5 dataset

## Docker image
We provide the setup of a docker image that can be used to develop and work on the hackathon task.
